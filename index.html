      <li><strong>Strathmore Univeristy</strong></li>
      <li>Alliance Francaise</li>
      <li><strong>Moringa School</strong></li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Job Experience</h3>

  <p>
    Being a student only goes to mean that this section will not have as much job Experience.<br>
    I have gotten to work at:
    <ol>
      <li>CMC Motors as their IT consultant</li>
      <li>Excel Suppliers as thier marketing manager</li>
      <li>Petra limited as their marketing manager</li>
    </ol>
    But I am still going to increase this list soon.
  </p>

  <h3>Why this?</h3>
  <img src="" alt="">
  <p>
    The reason I decided to join Moringa School was because of my passion to always learn new things.<br>
    Since I study at Strathmore Universtity (Beachelor of Business and Information technogy), I figured it would be a good idea if I came and did something more to add on to my portfolio, hence Moringa School.
